# ScatteringClique

This implementation reproduces the paper [*Can Hybrid Geometric Scattering Networks Help Solve the Maximum Clique Problem?*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.01506) by Min et al.

## Introduction

The scattering clique model combines graph neural networks with geometric scattering transforms to tackle the NP-hard maximum clique problem.
